This code represents an example of simplified ransomware, which aims to encrypt files on a computer to make them inaccessible. It uses a simple XOR encryption algorithm to encrypt files and generates a random key to encrypt these files. Once the files are encrypted, the user is informed that he/she has to pay a fee to unlock them, with a limited number of attempts to enter the correct key. If the correct key is not entered within the limited number of attempts, the files may be threatened with permanent deletion.

It is important to note that this code is only an example of ransomware and I am not responsible for any damage that may result from its use. Furthermore, I do not encourage its use for illegal purposes. It is intended for educational purposes only.

No library is used, so it can be easily converted to .exe.

It needs a lot of improvements like threading for encryption and decryption and selecting files to encrypt based on their extension.
