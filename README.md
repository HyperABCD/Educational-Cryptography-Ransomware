This code represents an example of simplified ransomware, which aims to encrypt files on a computer to make them inaccessible. It uses a simple XOR encryption algorithm to encrypt files and generates a random key to encrypt these files.

It is important to note that this code is only an example of ransomware and I am not responsible for any damage that may result from its use. Furthermore, I do not encourage its use for illegal purposes. It is intended for educational purposes only.
